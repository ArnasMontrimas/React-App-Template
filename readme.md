# Template For React Apps

I configured webpack, babel, eslint, prettier from scratch and created a template for starting react projects, here i keep track of plugins used with webpack and other tools like babel, eslint. I have also made a "development" webpack config and "production" config

I think this is a good starting point from here i can focus on building the app and add anything like Reach-Router, Redux or Next.js later down the line.
